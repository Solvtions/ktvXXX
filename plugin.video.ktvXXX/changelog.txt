v1.8
    - Set services.py to handle updating the user's userdata entry for message_xml_url for when the developer sets
        API Version to a higher number (so is updated just like APIs and Root XML is in these cases)
    - Added new settings for Addon/Web Login to access main menu in settings.xml:
        - use-account : Default is false, not visible to end user. Set this to true to activate login required
        - login_url : URL to the webpage used to verify username and password. Not visible to user
        - login_verified : Part of the text string returned in the html if login was verified/worked. Not visible to user
        - username : Visible to user, this is set by them for the username they are to use
        - password : Visible to user, this is set by them for the password they are to use
        - hide-successful-login-messages : Default is false, this allows user to disable the Login Successufl notification
    - Added strings to English strings.po for new settings.xml weblogin stuff
    - Added weblogin.py to root folder to handle the login work
        - If your site uses variables in the Post header other than username and password for those details, be sure
            to update the weblogin.py to reflect those. Most will use these variables though
    - Added cookies.lwp to root folder to store cookie data when logging in
    - Added login checks and code to the default.py to handle login methods
    - Added example php scripts to 'login' folder in root of Jen Template
        - These would be set up and configured on a web host that supports php and mysql, used to verify the
            login data the end user provides if you are not using another website to verify logins
        - These are NOT needed for login setups, if you are using an existing website with user accounts to verify
            login credentials. Just make sure the login_verified in settings.xml includes text unique to the login
            successful page that user's would get if they log in succesfully to your website

v1.7
    - root_xml_url in settings.xml now supports file://, http://, and base64 encoded strings
    - message_xml_url moved from news_window.py to the settings.xml file.
    - Added support for developer to choose urlresolver or resolveurl as their primary resolver
        - To switch from resolveurl to urlresolver, comment out the resolveurl link in addon.xml
            and uncomment the line for urlresolver
        - This only impacts Direct Links, as dependencies used may still use only resolveurl
    - Fixed missing Exception raised in tvdb api base. (Bugatsinho)
    - Updated addon.xml for Kodi 18 support - Backwards compatible with 17 (Bugatsinho)
